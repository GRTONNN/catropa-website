        <p><strong>The Queen’s Second Chance.</strong></p>
        <p>Once upon a whisker, in a world steeped in the aroma of karak tea, sweet treats, and the warm bustle of Arab hospitality, there lived a regal Persian beauty named Juliet. To those closest to her, she was simply Bebi. With her silken coat of light gray and white, and eyes as green and mesmerizing as an oasis at dusk, Bebi reigned supreme, not over palaces or gardens, but over the villa kingdom, where she was the undisputed queen.</p>
        <p>But Juliet wasn’t just a pretty face. She had a love story worthy of Shakespeare. Her partner? A dashing feline named Romeo. Together, they shared cozy naps, synchronized tail flicks, and even raised a litter of adorable kittens. Life was purrfect.</p>
        <p>Then came a twist in the tale. Juliet’s human, her original Furr Parent, received surprising news: a baby on the way, and the doctor’s orders to avoid cats. It was a heartbreaking moment. But instead of turning their backs on Juliet, her humans did something beautiful; they chose love over abandonment. They offered her up for adoption, hoping someone would see the magic in her.</p>
        <p>And that’s when fate stepped in.</p>
        <p>On <b>May 21, 2014.</b> Juliet found her new chapter with a kind-hearted officemate (that’s us!). From the moment she stepped into her new home, she brought elegance, sass, and a whole lot of cuddles. Her journey to become a beloved family member is a reminder that every cat deserves a second chance and a soft place to land.</p>

        <p><strong>Personality Vibes:</strong> Juliet is the embodiment of feline elegance with a dash of diva flair. She’s calm, composed, and carries herself like she’s always walking a red carpet, tail high, gaze mysterious, fur flawless. But don’t let her royal demeanor fool you; she's got these Kung Fu moves that surely you cannot escape.</p>
        <p><strong>Quirks & Habits:</strong> She’s always leaping with confidence, often to places just a whisker too high or far. The result? A graceful tumble, followed by a proud little shake as if to say, “I meant to do that.” And when it comes to hydration, only the finest will do: she insists her water be served in a freshly cleaned bowl, thank you very much.</p>

        <p><strong>The Whisper That Found a Home.</strong></p>
        <p>Mikmik’s tale began in Ajman, where she grew up alongside her former owner’s child. She was once the sunshine of the household, playful, curious, and always ready to pounce into fun. But one day, her spark faded. She grew quiet, curling up in corners instead of chasing shadows. Her owner, sadly, lost interest and decided it was time to let her go.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, our kind-hearted Jordanian friend knew both Mikmik and her story. He offered to help find her new fur parents—and that’s when he introduced her to us.</p>
        <p>The moment we met her, she looked straight at me and let out the softest, most soulful mikyaw. Our friend was stunned. “She never meows,” he said. “She never even moves unless she feels safe.” Right then, I knew we were meant to be her forever family.</p>
        <p>After bringing her to the vet, we discovered she had ear mites and an upset tummy. At first, we thought we’d help her recover and then find her a loving home. But twice she was offered, and twice she was gently turned away. Each time, she came back to us, quietly, patiently, as if she already knew…</p>
        <p>So we listened with open hearts. We cuddled through quiet moments. We loved her, just as she was and decided to keep her fur-ever♥</p>

        <p><strong>Personality Vibes:</strong> Sweet, soft-spoken, and full of quiet charm.

As the second adopted cat, she’s never bossy, just beautifully balanced and endlessly patient.</p>
        <p><strong>Quirks & Habits:</strong> Her signature <em>mikyaw</em> is rare and precious, reserved for moments of true connection. Has a heart-melting habit of placing her paw gently on your face when you’re sad, especially with children. It’s her way of saying, “I’m here.”</p>
