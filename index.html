        <p><strong>The Queen’s Second Chance.</strong></p>
        <p>Once upon a whisker, in a world steeped in the aroma of karak tea, sweet treats, and the warm bustle of Arab hospitality, there lived a regal Persian beauty named Juliet. To those closest to her, she was simply Bebi. With her silken coat of light gray and white, and eyes as green and mesmerizing as an oasis at dusk, Bebi reigned supreme, not over palaces or gardens, but over the villa kingdom, where she was the undisputed queen.</p>
        <p>But Juliet wasn’t just a pretty face. She had a love story worthy of Shakespeare. Her partner? A dashing feline named Romeo. Together, they shared cozy naps, synchronized tail flicks, and even raised a litter of adorable kittens. Life was purrfect.</p>
        <p>Then came a twist in the tale. Juliet’s human, her original Furr Parent, received surprising news: a baby on the way, and the doctor’s orders to avoid cats. It was a heartbreaking moment. But instead of turning their backs on Juliet, her humans did something beautiful; they chose love over abandonment. They offered her up for adoption, hoping someone would see the magic in her.</p>
        <p>And that’s when fate stepped in.</p>
        <p>On <b>May 21, 2014.</b> Juliet found her new chapter with a kind-hearted officemate (that’s us!). From the moment she stepped into her new home, she brought elegance, sass, and a whole lot of cuddles. Her journey to become a beloved family member is a reminder that every cat deserves a second chance and a soft place to land.</p>

        <p><strong>Personality Vibes:</strong> Juliet is the embodiment of feline elegance with a dash of diva flair. She’s calm, composed, and carries herself like she’s always walking a red carpet, tail high, gaze mysterious, fur flawless. But don’t let her royal demeanor fool you; she's got these Kung Fu moves that surely you cannot escape.</p>
        <p><strong>Quirks & Habits:</strong> She’s always leaping with confidence, often to places just a whisker too high or far. The result? A graceful tumble, followed by a proud little shake as if to say, “I meant to do that.” And when it comes to hydration, only the finest will do: she insists her water be served in a freshly cleaned bowl, thank you very much.</p>

        <p><strong>The Whisper That Found a Home.</strong></p>
        <p>Mikmik’s tale began in Ajman, where she grew up alongside her former owner’s child. She was once the sunshine of the household, playful, curious, and always ready to pounce into fun. But one day, her spark faded. She grew quiet, curling up in corners instead of chasing shadows. Her owner, sadly, lost interest and decided it was time to let her go.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, our kind-hearted Jordanian friend knew both Mikmik and her story. He offered to help find her new fur parents—and that’s when he introduced her to us.</p>
        <p>The moment we met her, she looked straight at me and let out the softest, most soulful mikyaw. Our friend was stunned. “She never meows,” he said. “She never even moves unless she feels safe.” Right then, I knew we were meant to be her forever family.</p>
        <p>After bringing her to the vet, we discovered she had ear mites and an upset tummy. At first, we thought we’d help her recover and then find her a loving home. But twice she was offered, and twice she was gently turned away. Each time, she came back to us, quietly, patiently, as if she already knew…</p>
        <p>So we listened with open hearts. We cuddled through quiet moments. We loved her, just as she was and decided to keep her fur-ever♥</p>

        <p><strong>Personality Vibes:</strong> Sweet, soft-spoken, and full of quiet charm.

        <p><strong>Quirks & Habits:</strong> Her signature <em>mikyaw</em> is rare and precious, reserved for moments of true connection. Has a heart-melting habit of placing her paw gently on your face when you’re sad, especially with children. It’s her way of saying, “I’m here.”</p>

        <p><strong>The Wounded Warrior Who Became Alpha.</strong></p>
        <p>Way back in 2018, we first met Maku at the pantry door of an office in Al Montazah Park. She was tiny, barely a month old, thin, hungry, and heartbreakingly wounded. Her left arm had a deep, visible injury, and you could feel the pain she was carrying just by looking at her.</p>
        <p>The next day, we returned with food for the stray kittens. Maku ate gratefully, and that’s when we knew, we couldn’t leave her behind. We brought her to the vet, where she was gently sedated so her infected wound could be thoroughly cleaned. Her cries during treatment were raw and real, proof of the pain she had endured far too early in life.</p>
        <p>The vet told us plainly: if we hadn’t brought her in, she would’ve slowly died from the infection.</p>
        <p>At first, we planned to foster her just until she healed. But the universe had other plans. Seven years later, she’s still with us, strong, sassy, and proudly living her <b>Alpha attitude.</b></p>
        <p>She may have started life in pain, but today she rules her world with confidence, courage, and a whole lot of cattitude.</p>

        <div class="cat-profile__details">
        <p><strong>Personality Vibes:</strong> Confident, fearless, and full of sass. Maku is a chatterbox with strong opinions, she’ll meow her thoughts loud and proud, especially when things don’t go her way. And if she disagrees? She’ll turn her back, face the wall, and sulk in silent protest like a tiny, furry philosopher. As the proud Alpha of the crew, she’s protective, independent, and always one paw ahead. But beneath that bold exterior is a survivor’s heart and a soft spot for those she loves.</p>
        <p><strong>Quirks & Habits:</strong></p>Has a signature strut that says <i>“I run this place”.</i> Prefers her space but will surprise you with sudden cuddles on her terms of course. Gives side-eye to loud noises and unfamiliar guests but warms up with time and treats. Meticulously organized with her food, water and grass. Also, must be arranged just right or she’ll stare, pace, and politely protest until everything is in perfect order.

        <p><strong>Best Friend(s):</strong> She’s closest to <b>Mikmik</b> - her quiet caretaker during her early days of healing, gentle, patient, and always nearby when <b>Maku</b> needed comfort. Respects <b>Juliet's</b> elegance and tolerates Monmon’s calm and occasionally challenges him just to keep things spicy.

        <p><strong>From Street Watcher to Sofa Snoozer.</strong></p>
        <p>Nika was a familiar face in our neighborhood, a quiet, scruffy little cat who lived near the entrance of our residential building. She wasn’t loud or demanding, just patiently waiting each day for someone kind enough to offer her a meal. We’d often see her sitting by the doorway, watching people come and go like a silent gatekeeper.</p>
        <p>Though we fed her regularly, Nika remained aloof and wary of humans. We never knew why, maybe life hadn’t been kind to her before. But day by day, she started to recognize us. She’d stare as we left for work and wait for us to return, her eyes following us like she was trying to understand our rhythm.</p>
        <p>What truly tugged at our hearts was her uncanny resemblance to our beloved cat back in the Philippines, <b>Niko</b>. It felt like fate had placed her there, waiting for us to notice.</p>
        <p>And one day, we did more than notice—we brought her home.</p>
        <p>Her first act as a newly adopted cat? She pooped right at our doorstep. 😂 A nervous welcome, but one we’ll never forget.</p>
        <p>Now at six years old, Nika is still a bit skittish. Trips to the vet or unfamiliar sounds can trigger her <i>“panic poop”</i> or <i>“fear pee”</i> reflex. But she’s ours, quirks and all—and we wouldn’t trade her for the world.</p>
