  <h5 class="profile-section-title">Adoption / Rescue Tale:</h5>
  <p><strong>The Queen‚Äôs Second Chance.</strong></p>
 
  <p>Once upon a whisker, in a world steeped in the aroma of karak tea, sweet treats, and the warm bustle of Arab hospitality, there lived a regal Persian beauty named Juliet.
  To those closest to her, she was simply Bebi. With her silken coat of light gray and white, and eyes as green and mesmerizing as an oasis at dusk,
  Bebi reigned supreme, not over palaces or gardens, but over the villa kingdom, where she was the undisputed queen.</p>


  <p>But Juliet wasn‚Äôt only a pretty face. She had a love story worthy of Shakespeare. Her partner? A dashing feline named Romeo.
  Together, they shared cozy naps, synchronized tail flicks, and even raised a litter of adorable kittens. Life was purrfect.</p>


  <p>Then came a twist. Juliet‚Äôs human, her original Furr Parent, received surprising news: a baby on the way, and the doctor‚Äôs orders to avoid cats. It was a heartbreaking moment.
   But instead of turning their backs on Juliet, her humans did something beautiful, they chose love over abandonment.
   They offered her up for adoption, hoping someone would see the magic in her.</p>
           
  <p>And that‚Äôs when fate stepped in.</p>
  <p>On May 21, 2014, Juliet found her new chapter with a kind-hearted officemate (that‚Äôs us!).
  From the moment she stepped into her new home, she brought elegance, sass, and a whole lot of cuddles.
  Her journey to become a beloved family member is a reminder that every cat deserves a second chance and a soft place to land.</p>

            <p><strong>The Whisper That Found a Home</strong></p>
            <p>Mikmik‚Äôs tale began in Ajman, where she grew up alongside her former owner‚Äôs child. She was once the sunshine of the household, playful, curious, and always ready to pounce into fun.
            But one day, her spark faded. She grew quiet, curling up in corners instead of chasing shadows. Her owner, sadly, lost interest and decided it was time to let her go.</p>
           
            <p>The moment we met her, she looked straight at me and let out the softest, most soulful mikyaw. Our friend was stunned.
            ‚ÄúShe never meows,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe never even moves unless she feels safe.‚Äù
            Right then, I knew, we were meant to be her forever family.</p>
           
            <p>After bringing her to the vet, we discovered she had ear mites and an upset tummy.
            At first, we thought we‚Äôd help her recover and then find her a loving home.
            But twice she was offered, and twice she was gently turned away. Each time, she came back to us, quietly, patiently, as if she already knew‚Ä¶</p>
           
            <p>So we listened with open hearts.</p>
            <p>We cuddled through quiet moments.</p>
            <p>We loved her, just as she was.</p>
            <p>And decided to keep her fur-ever ‚ô•</p>

      <p><strong>Quirks & Habits:</strong></p>
      <p>Her signature mikyaw is rare and precious, reserved for moments of true connection. She has a heart-melting habit of placing her paw gently on your face when you‚Äôre sad, especially with children. It‚Äôs her way of saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here.‚Äù</p>

            <p><strong>The Wounded Warrior Who Became Alpha</strong></p>
            <p>Way back in 2018, we first met Maku at the pantry door of an office in Al Montazah Park.
            She was tiny, barely a month old, thin, hungry, and heartbreakingly wounded.
            Her left arm had a deep, visible injury, and you could feel the pain she was carrying just by looking at her.</p>


            <p>The next day, we returned with food for the stray kittens.
            Maku ate gratefully, and that‚Äôs when we knew, we couldn‚Äôt leave her behind.
            We brought her to the vet, where she was gently sedated so her infected wound could be thoroughly cleaned.
            Her cries during treatment were raw and real, proof of the pain she had endured far too early in life.</p>


            <p>The vet told us plainly, if we hadn‚Äôt brought her in, she would‚Äôve slowly died from the infection.</p>


            <p>At first, we planned to foster her only until she healed. But the universe had other plans.
            Seven years later, she‚Äôs still with us, strong, sassy, and proudly living her Alpha attitude.</p>


            <p>She may have started life in pain, but today she rules her world with confidence, courage, and a whole lot of cattitude.</p>

      <p>She‚Äôs closest to Mikmik, her quiet caretaker during her early days of healing, gentle, patient, and always nearby when Maku needed comfort. Respects Juliet‚Äôs elegance, tolerates Monmon‚Äôs calm, and occasionally challenges him just to keep things spicy.</p>

            <p><strong>From Street Watcher to Sofa Snoozer</strong></p>
            <p>Nika was a familiar face in our neighborhood, a quiet, scruffy little cat who lived near the entrance of our residential building. She wasn‚Äôt loud or demanding, only patiently waiting each day for someone kind enough to offer her a meal.
            We‚Äôd often see her sitting by the doorway, watching people come and go like a silent gatekeeper.</p>


            <p>Though we fed her regularly, Nika remained aloof and wary of humans. We never knew why, maybe life hadn‚Äôt been kind to her before. But day by day, she started to recognize us.
            She‚Äôd stare as we left for work and wait for us to return, her eyes following us like she was trying to understand our rhythm.</p>


            <p>What truly tugged at our hearts was her uncanny resemblance to our beloved cat back in the Philippines, Niko.
            It felt like fate had placed her there, waiting for us to notice.</p>


            <p>And one day, we did more than notice‚Äîwe brought her home.</p>


            <p>Her first act as a newly adopted cat? She pooped right at our doorstep. üòÇ
            A nervous welcome, but one we‚Äôll never forget.</p>


            <p>Now at six years old, Nika is still a bit skittish. Trips to the vet or unfamiliar sounds can trigger her ‚Äúpanic poop‚Äù or ‚Äúfear pee‚Äù reflex.
            But she‚Äôs ours, quirks and all‚Äîand we wouldn‚Äôt trade her for the world.</p>

        <p><strong>The Day He Chose Us</strong></p>
        <p>Grey Summer, our first male cat and, in many ways, our first love.
          We called him Monmon because the name just fit his gentle, soulful vibe.
          His story began at our workplace. During break time, I‚Äôd sit outside under a tree near the pantry, and like clockwork, Monmon would quietly appear.
          No meowing, no begging, just a calm presence beside me. He‚Äôd sniff my bag, settle in, and keep me company like a furry little lunch buddy.</p>
       
        <p>Unlike the other stray cats who would gather noisily around the pantry, Monmon never joined the crowd.
           He waited patiently, walked with me to the gate after every shift, and knew exactly where his food and water were, in our car, Pogee.
          It became our secret routine, like a daily date with a silent suitor.</p>


        <p>One day, we joked: ‚ÄúIf he climbs into the driver‚Äôs seat, that means he wants to come home.‚Äù
           And guess what? He did.We hesitated. Juliet, Mikmik, Maku, and Nika were already part of our growing CATropa.
           But Monmon didn‚Äôt just ask to join. He belonged.<p>
        <p>Jaraaaannnnn! He‚Äôs now our Mr. Tabby Cat, our quiet king, and the heart of our crew.</p>


        <p>Walks you to the gate like a gentleman escort</p>
        <p>Sniffs your bag like he‚Äôs checking for secrets</p>
        <p>Prefers solo moments over noisy crowds</p>

         <p><strong>The Fighter Beneath the Fur</strong></p>
         <p>Just across from our home is Sharjah Coop, where we buy our groceries.
          That‚Äôs where we first met her, a fierce little tortoiseshell cat who ruled the entrance like a queen.
          She was the only cat living there, she didn‚Äôt tolerate intruders. Any stray who dared step into her territory was swiftly chased off.
          But beneath that tough exterior, she had a soft spot for humans.</p>


        <p>She loved people more than fellow furry creatures.
          Every night after work, we‚Äôd feed her along with the other strays.
          She never begged or made noise, just waited patiently, always calm, always present.</p>


        <p>Then one day, she was gone.


        <p>Days passed. Then weeks. No sign of her.
          We hoped someone with a kind heart had adopted her. But the truth was far more heartbreaking.</p>


        <p>She returned, wounded, limping, with a curved shoulder and a deep, long gash down her back.
          We didn‚Äôt know what had happened, but we knew one thing: she needed help.</p>


        <p>We didn‚Äôt hesitate. We took her in, found a vet, and started raising funds to cover her treatment.
          It was the height of COVID, and vet care in the UAE is expensive.
          But thanks to generous souls who stepped in, she got the care she needed.</p>


        <p>Fast forward: we adopted her without a second thought.</p>
       
        <p>After all the pain, the struggle, and the near-death experience she endured, all we wanted was to give her a better life, a safe, loving home where she could finally rest.</p>
       
        <p>Today, she‚Äôs healed. We hope her heart and mind are healing, too.
          She shows us love every day, grateful in ways only a rescued soul can be.</p>
       
        <p>We named her Kali, short for Kalayaan, because we rescued her on June 12, 2020, Philippine Independence Day.
            She‚Äôs our little warrior, our symbol of freedom, and our reminder that love always finds a way.</p>

        <p><strong>The Leaf-Loving Gentleman Nobody Understood</strong></p>
        <p>Down by the sand parking near our building, Happy Home, Sharjah, lived a tiny black-and-white cat we called Max Ruru.
          Two-toned, wide-eyed, and always alone. While other strays chased each other or begged for food, Max spent his days quietly playing with dry leaves and bits of plastic like they were prized possessions.
          He had a whole playground to himself‚Ä¶ but no playmates.</p>


          <p>We used to wonder: "Why doesn‚Äôt anyone want to play with Max? He wasn‚Äôt aggressive.
            He wasn‚Äôt loud. He was just‚Ä¶ different.</p>


          <p>One day, a friend of ours was looking to adopt a cat. We immediately thought of Max.
            He was cute, handsome, and clearly in need of companionship.
            So we scooped him up and gave him his first taste of a furrever home.
            Everything was perfect, until it wasn‚Äôt.</p>


          <p>Turns out, both of our friends‚Äô daughters had cat allergies. Heartbroken, they had to return Max.
            And suddenly, we were faced with a dilemma. We already had six cats, Juliet, Mikmik, Maku, Nika, Mermer, and Potpot, and we weren‚Äôt sure we could handle one more.
            We worried about space, care, medication, and whether we could give him the love he truly deserved.</p>


          <p>But Max had already chosen us. And honestly? We couldn‚Äôt say no.</p>


          <p>Fast forward four years: that tiny leaf-playing boy is now a full-grown gentleman, still a little misunderstood, but deeply loved.
            We‚Äôve noticed something special about him. Other cats tend to avoid him, and we‚Äôre not entirely sure why.
            The vet suspects he may have special needs, or maybe it‚Äôs just his white fur that makes him seem like a threat to the others.
            Whatever the reason, Max has always been a bit of an outsider in the CATropa crew.</p>


          <p>But to us? He‚Äôs soft as cotton, warm as a blanket, and full of quiet love that only we truly understand.</p>


          <p>His mortal enemies? Nika and Maku. There‚Äôs tension. There‚Äôs drama. There‚Äôs the occasional side-eye across the room.
            But we‚Äôre holding out hope that one day, a miracle will happen, and they‚Äôll all share a sunbeam in peace.</p>

        <p><strong>The Wounded Wanderer with a Mickey Mouse Mark</strong></p>
        <p>At first, we thought he was just another stray asking for food, like so many others who find their way to us.
          We met him near our home, at the ADNOC petrol station, where we regularly fed the local crew of street cats.
          He approached quietly, no meows, no fuss. Just a slow walk and a tired stare.</p>


        <p>But then we saw it.</p>


        <p>His legs were wrapped in a makeshift bandage, and there was a deep, raw cut on his thigh.
          This wasn‚Äôt a cat asking for food, this was a cat asking for help.
          We rushed him to the vet. The doctor believed he‚Äôd been run over, treated briefly, and then dumped back on the street to ‚Äúheal‚Äù on his own. No one knew how long he‚Äôd been like that, days, maybe weeks.
          His wound was badly infected, full of maggots, and so deep you could almost see the bone.</p>


        <p>We didn‚Äôt hesitate. We took him in, determined to help him heal. But it wasn‚Äôt easy. The CATropa crew didn‚Äôt welcome him.
          He was white, with patches of black and yellow, and somehow they saw him as a threat. Maybe it was his scent, his energy, maybe just the trauma he carried. His wound refused to heal quickly.
          Alongside antibiotics, we used Manuka honey, a natural remedy with healing powers, to help close the wound. It took over a year before it fully healed.
          And another year before he could walk and play properly again.</p>


        <p>But through it all, one cat stood by him: Max Ruru.</p>


        <p>Max, our quiet leaf collector, saw something in Sensei. Maybe it was the loneliness.
          Maybe it was the pain. Maybe it was just fate. Max loved him like a best friend.
          And honestly? Max convinced us to keep him. He needed a companion, and Sensei had already stolen our hearts.</p>


        <p>We named him Sensei because he taught us patience, resilience, and the quiet strength of survival.</p>


        <p>Oh, and the best part? He has a marking on his body shaped like Mickey Mouse.
          When we first saw him, we joked that he looked like a mouse, tiny, fragile, and oddly adorable.
          But now? He‚Äôs soft, kind, and silky smooth. A survivor with a shiny coat and a heart full of gratitude.</p>


        <p>Sensei didn‚Äôt just heal. He became family.</p>

  <h5 class="profile-section-title">Feeding & Nutrition</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Feed adults twice daily; kittens need smaller, more frequent meals.</li>
    <li>Choose high-protein, meat-first foods. Cats are obligate carnivores.</li>
    <li>Keep fresh water available at all times. A fountain can make hydration more fun.</li>
    <li>Adjust diets for age, allergies, or health needs‚Äîyour vet can guide you.</li>
    <li>Never share foods like onions, garlic, chocolate, or alcohol. They're toxic to cats.</li>
  </ul>


  <h5 class="profile-section-title">Grooming & Hygiene</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Brush long-haired cats daily; short-haired ones weekly.</li>
    <li>Bathe only when needed‚Äîcats are excellent self-groomers.</li>
    <li>Trim nails every few weeks to prevent snags and scratches.</li>
    <li>Clean ears gently and brush teeth regularly (or schedule vet cleanings).</li>
  </ul>


  <h5 class="profile-section-title">Health & Vet Care</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Schedule annual checkups for vaccines and wellness exams.</li>
    <li>Spay or neuter to support long-term health and reduce behavioral issues.</li>
    <li>Watch for changes in appetite, litter box habits, or energy levels.</li>
    <li>Signs of wellness include a shiny coat, clear eyes, and playful curiosity.</li>
  </ul>


  <h5 class="profile-section-title">Environment & Enrichment</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Scoop litter daily and place boxes in quiet, low-traffic areas.</li>
    <li>Offer cozy beds, blankets, and hideaways for comfort and security.</li>
    <li>Rotate toys, add puzzle feeders, and encourage climbing or scratching.</li>
    <li>Secure windows and balconies to keep curious explorers safe.</li>
  </ul>


  <h5 class="profile-section-title">Behavior & Socialization</h5>
